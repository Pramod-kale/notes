# This Repo is made for maintaining the notes about the stuffs I read for preparing for interviews.
## The code includes both javascript and typescript. i have used node js for runtime.

- `./src/SystemDesign` contains highlights and new important topics I learn in frontend system design, mainly learnt from [greatfrontend.com](https://greatfrontend.com).
- `./src/DSA` contains courses I attended from ZTM/Frontend Masters.
- `./src/Javascript` contains all the core knowledge related to JavaScript.

I will not emphasize more on the HTML and CSS part.
