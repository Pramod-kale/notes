// There are 4 rules to follow while simplifying big O
//     1) Worst case - this tells that it is always the worst case which is considered because this will be the worst thing might happen to the code

//     2) Remove constants - it really doesn't matter the number of iteration we do on the loop if it does loop with other constants the
//       constants should be dropped
//        O(2n) => O(n)

//     3) Different terms of input -  big o depends if there are different inputs if they are in same indentation
//  add those if they are nested multiply those //! refer 4)big(O)-example logPairsOfArray() function


//     4) Drop the non dominant terms - with the consideration of scalability we can drop of the non dominant constant and keep the terms which concerns or effects
//        the efficiency //! refer 4)big(O)-example second function
