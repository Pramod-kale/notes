//$ LINEAR SEARCH
// this lilnear search user iterative method to search for the matching element in an given array
// doesn't matter if the array is sorted or unsorted because it will visit all the elements to compare

//@ assume for loop for the example it checks through all the elements in the array no matter if it is sorted or unsorted



//!----------------------------------------------------------
//$ BINARY SEARCH
// this binary search uses divide and conquer approach,
// this type of searching requires sorted list

//@ 1) checks for the middle element of given list or array whether it is equal to the required element
//@ 2) if the middle element is not equal to the required element, it discards the element which is towards it's left (which are smaller than the required element)
//@ 3) repeats the same for the elements towards it right, checks for the matching element, if not discard the left elements and search again in the middle element

//# if it is sorted we can acheive better than O(n)
//# similar to binary search tree
