when to use arrays and when not, what they are best at

    Advantages-
        they are fast at lookup, faster data search
        fast adding and removing data from them
        they are ordered
    
    Disvantages-
        slow inserts into the array at the middle part of an array
        same applies for deleting elements from them
        those are fixed in size if we are talking about static arrays
