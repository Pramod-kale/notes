**Next Steps:** Learn recursion with linked list problems (e.g., reverse a linked list recursively).

### Doubly Linked List

#### Practice Algorithms:
- Same as above but using both forward and backward traversal.

### Stack & Queue

#### Practice Algorithms:
- Depth-First Search (DFS) uses a stack.

- Priority Queue operations (Insert/Delete/Peek).
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (to find shortest path).

**Next Steps:** Learn graph traversal using heaps.

### Priority Queue

- Use with Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths.

## Intermediate Level

### Tree (Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree)

#### Practice Algorithms:
- Tree Traversals: Preorder, Inorder, Postorder (DFS).
- Insert/Search/Delete in BST.
- Balanced trees (AVL, Red-Black Tree): Learn how to maintain balance.
- Use Binary Search Trees in problems like range sum or finding the k-th smallest element.

**Next Steps:** Solve dynamic programming problems on trees (e.g., maximum path sum).

### Trie

#### Practice Algorithms:
- String search problems (e.g., autocomplete).
- Prefix matching algorithms.
- Longest common prefix.

**Next Steps:** Solve pattern matching algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp) which relate to string processing.

### Graph

#### Practice Algorithms:
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Shortest Path Algorithms: Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford.
- Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal's, Prim's).
- Topological Sorting (for DAG).

**Next Steps:** Practice advanced graph problems like strongly connected components, Hamiltonian cycle, and Eulerian path.

### Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

#### Practice Algorithms:
- Kruskal's Algorithm for MST.
- Detecting cycles in graphs.

**Next Steps:** Solve problems that involve dynamic connectivity like social networks, or problems on finding connected components.

## Advanced Level

### Segment Tree

#### Practice Algorithms:
- Range queries (min/max/sum).
- Range updates (point updates, lazy propagation).

**Next Steps:** Learn Fenwick Tree for similar range query problems with different use cases.

### Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)

#### Practice Algorithms:
- Range sum queries.
- 2D range queries (for problems like submatrix sum).

**Next Steps:** Compare with segment trees for different types of query problems.

### LRU Cache

#### Practice Algorithms:
- Implement LRU cache using a combination of hash map and doubly linked list.

**Next Steps:** Explore more about cache algorithms like LFU (Least Frequently Used).

### Bloom Filter

#### Practice Algorithms:
- Probabilistic set membership test (useful in Big Data applications).

## Algorithm Learning Path

### Sorting Algorithms (Merge Sort, QuickSort, Heap Sort):
- Start with these to practice data structures like arrays and heaps.
- Understanding sorting is key to solving many other complex problems.

### Dynamic Programming:
- Learn after you are comfortable with recursion.
- Focus on problems like Fibonacci, Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), and Maximum Subarray.
- Practice with trees and graphs, where many dynamic programming techniques are applicable (e.g., DP on trees).

### Greedy Algorithms:
- Useful for problems like Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's MST, and Huffman Coding.

### Divide and Conquer:
- Essential for Merge Sort, QuickSort, and Binary Search.
- Extend this to more advanced problems like Maximum Subarray or matrix multiplication.<!--  -->
