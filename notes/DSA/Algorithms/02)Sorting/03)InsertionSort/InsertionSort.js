// this type of sorting comes up when you think the list is almost sorted and we get almost o(n)
// time complexity


// first check the size of the element and compare it to the first element and decide where it should be position according the conpared value
// and make those two as a set, then check for third element and compare that to the set which already has made and decide where it should be inserted
// and thiskeeps on going
