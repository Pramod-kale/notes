//  graphs are set of values related in a pair wise, graphs are very usefull in modelling real world relation modals.
// for example these can be used to represent friends, families, roads connecting towns
// graphs consists of element called as nodes, lines connecting them called as edges

//@ Types of graphs
//* these kind of graphs are used to describing traffic flows,
// 1) directed graphs //! these have arrow marks showing direction of flow in which data will only flow in that direction
// 2) undirected graphs //! these doesn't have arrow indincating the direction and the data can flow  between the nodes
// 3) unweighted graphs //! edges have arrow marks and doesn't carry any information with them
// 4) weighted graphs //! edges does have arrow marks  and carry values along the with them
// 5) cyclic //! vertices are connected to each other forming a closed loop
// 5) acyclic //! vertices are not connected to each other

// graphs can also carry information in the edges as well as in the nodes


// graphs can be represented in 3 ways, adjacency matric, adjacency list, edge list
//  for  the visual representation refer the link https://visualgo.net/en/graphds


// pros
// they are good at relationships

// cons
// scaling is hard
