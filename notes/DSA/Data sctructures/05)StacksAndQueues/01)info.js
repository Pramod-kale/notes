// ! Javascript doesn't have stacks and queues of it's own

//  these two are linear data structures, linear DS allow us traverse throught elements sequentually

// ? Stacks => stacks uses the LIFO method that is last in first out
//  if we need to access any particular element we need to go through all the in between element till we find what was needed
//  it has the  time complexity of O(1) for pop, push, peak and o(n) for lookup

// ? Queues => Queues uses the  FIFO method that is the first in first out
//  similar to stacks queues has 4 different operations such as
// lookup
// enqueue for adding a element into the queue at last
// dequeue for removing the element from the queue, but this will remove the element which was entered first
//  peek will return the first element that is going to come out

// it has big O notation of O(1) for enqueue,dequeue, peek and O(n) for lookup
