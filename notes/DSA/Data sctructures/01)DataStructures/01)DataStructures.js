// * algorithms are the steps we put into to manipulate the values

// ! what is data structure
// * data structures are collextion of values

// ! how data sctructure store data
// * the data are stored in RAM for faster acces to the variables, in the long run to access for later use case it will get stored in the memory,
// * also the cpu have some small amount of memory in it what we call as cache to store the frequently used variables to speed things up

// ? generally 8 bits strore 255 characters,
// ? 16 bits store 65536
// ? 32 bits store 2,147,483,647
// ? 64 bits store 9223722036854775807 characters



//! what are the operation on data structures
// ? 1)insertion 2)deletion 3)traversal 4)searching 5)sorting 6)access
