//  there are some other types f trees 1) heap tree 2) trie
//  heap tree has binary heap which obviously contains only two childrens.
// it has nodes in a structure called max heap. that means the child node values shoud be lesser that their parent node values.
//  it has a time complexity of O(n) for lookup and o(log N) for insert and delete
